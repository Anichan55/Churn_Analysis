# Churn_Analysis

This project builds a churn predictive system using an artificial neural network to predict the customers that are likely to leave the service in near future. It helps to find out which customers are not satisfied with the service of the Telecom Service provider and thereby helps the service provider to focus on those customers and modify their existing plans so that it helps in customer retention.
